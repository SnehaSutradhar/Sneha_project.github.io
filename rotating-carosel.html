              <p class="text-center p-4"> Rhyno is equipped with Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries,
                renowned for their safety features—eliminating the risk of fire associated with other
                Lithium batteries. These batteries boast a broader temperature range, ideal for the
                diverse Indian climate. Our technology enhances Rhyno's longevity, complemented
                by an Active Balancing Smart Battery Management System (BMS) for extended life
                and reduced maintenance. Each battery undergoes rigorous waterproofing tests
                according to IP76 standards. But it doesn't stop there—our technology goes the extra
                mile in ensuring the battery's lasting durability. Connect with us to discover the
                thoughtful engineering behind our batteries!</p>

              <p class="text-center p-4"> We’ve had enough of the EVs looking and feeling like
                fragile plastic toys. Often fading out and shamelessly breaking in minor accidents,
                ending up spending weeks and months at service stations for complex repairs. We
                took a bold step of making something raw, rugged, and practical. We kept it so
                simple that even your trusted local mechanic can understand and repair most of it. If
                you have reached this far, why not to take a test ride? Click here to locate your
                nearest dealership or book a test ride at your home.</p>
